<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hernia Surgical Mesh Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Absorbable Mesh Implants</li><li>Absorbable Mesh Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hernia surgical mesh implants market consists of two main types: non-absorbable and absorbable mesh implants. Non-absorbable mesh implants are made from synthetic materials that remain in the body permanently, providing long-term support for tissue repair. Conversely, absorbable mesh implants are designed to gradually break down and be absorbed by the body over time, allowing natural tissue healing while reducing long-term foreign material presence. Both types are used to effectively treat various hernia conditions, catering to different patient needs and surgical outcomes.</p></p>
